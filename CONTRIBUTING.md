# Introduction
 Welcome to my first Open Source project! I am thrilled you chose to contirbute to this project and hope you find it a rewarding experience. I started this project to learn more about Open Source and to connect with CS majors, like myself, who are looking to work on personal projects together.

# Why you should read these guidelines:
 Following these guidelines shows that you respect the time I put into this application and you want to contribute in the most effective way possible.

# What type of contributions I am looking for:
 There are so many ways to contribute! From improving documentation, submitting bug reports or writing your own code which can be incorporated into the application itself! If you would like to make a **small change** please submit a pull request as per the guidelines specified below. For a **major change** please first submit an issue to we can discuss your idea as a community. 
 
 # Found a bug? 
  Let us know by submitting an issue! Even better, try to fix it and submit a pull request with your fix!
 
 # Want to implement a new feature?
  Request your new feature to the team by submitting an issue to our Github Repo.
  
 # Want to improve documentation?
  You can open an issue and outline the problem or improvement you have to our documentation- or you can create the doc fix yourself!

For effecient improvement, it's a good idea to give others a heads up on what you're working on minimize duplication of effort. You can create a new issue (or comment on a related existing one) to let others know what you're working on.

For a **small change** (typo, phrasing) you don't have to file an issue first. Use the friendly blue "Improve this doc" button at the top right of the doc page to fork the repository in-place and make a quick change on the fly. The commit message is preformatted to the right type and scope, so you only have to add the description.

For **major changes**, please build and test the documentation before submitting the pull request to be sure you haven't accidentally introduced any layout or formatting issues. You should also make sure that your commit message follows the Commit Message Guidelines.
  
 # Issue Submitting Guidelines
  Before submitting an issue, search the archives for something similiar. We don't want duplicate issues running around. Please fill out the "new issue" form attached to each issue request to better categorize our issues.
  
  # Pull Request Submission Guidelines
  * please only work on a feature with an open issue.
  * make all changes in a new branch
  * commit changes using a descriptive commit message

# Ground Rules(for me and you):
1. Be respectful and welcoming to newcomers! All questions are welcome. This is a learning process for me and you :)
2. Create issues for any new change you wish to make. This will allow for community feedback.
