# Introduction
## Welcome to my first Open Source project! I am thrilled you chose to contirbute to this project and hope you find it a rewarding experience. I started this project to learn more about Open Source and to connect with CS majors, like myself, who are looking to work on personal projects together.

# Why you should read these guidelines:
## Following these guidelines shows that you respect the time I put into this application and you want to contribute in the most effective way possible.

# What type of contributions I am looking for:
## There are so many ways to contribute! From improving documentation, submitting bug reports or writing your own code which can be incorporated into the application itself!

# Ground Rules(for me and you):
## 1. Be respectful and welcoming to newcomers! All questions are welcome. This is a learning process for me and you :)
## 2. Create issues for any new change you wish to make. This will allow for community feedback.

## New to the process and want some helpful tips? Check out

### Now you're ready to make some changes! I'm excited to see what you have to contribute and feel free to ask for help! We are all learning here :)
